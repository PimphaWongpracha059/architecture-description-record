# Migration to GraphQL Subscriptions for Real-time Updates

## Context
In our application, we have a requirement for real-time updates to reflect changes made by users immediately across all connected clients. The current approach using traditional REST APIs requires continuous polling or separate WebSocket connections, leading to increased network traffic and complexity.

## Decision
We propose migrating to GraphQL subscriptions to facilitate real-time updates efficiently and simplify the management of real-time data in our application.

## Rationale
We choose GraphQL subscriptions because they provide a standardized and efficient way to implement real-time updates in our application. By using subscriptions, clients can subscribe to specific data changes and receive updates instantly without the need for continuous polling or managing separate WebSocket connections. Additionally, GraphQL subscriptions integrate seamlessly with our existing GraphQL server, reducing implementation complexity.

## Consequences
Pros:
- Real-time updates: Clients receive updates immediately as changes occur, enhancing the user experience.
- Reduced network traffic: GraphQL subscriptions eliminate the need for continuous polling, reducing unnecessary network requests.
- Simplified architecture: Migrating to GraphQL subscriptions streamlines the real-time data management process, leading to a more maintainable and scalable architecture.

Cons:
- Learning curve: Developers may require training to understand and implement GraphQL subscriptions effectively.
- Initial implementation effort: Migrating to GraphQL subscriptions requires updates to both server-side and client-side code, which may require significant development resources.

## Sample code GraphQL
```graphql
subscription {
  newPost {
    id
    title
    content
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
